</p>

chrono-ntp is a simple command-line tool that synchronizes with an NTP (Network Time Protocol) server to account for any difference between your computerâ€™s clock and the actual time, displaying the precise date and time in your terminal.

You can use chrono-ntp to set your mechanical or digital watches or as a minimal distraction-free terminal clock.

## Getting Started

You can download the latest release from the [releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/ingk/chrono-ntp/releases).

Simply download the appropriate binary for your platform and follow the usage instructions.

### Installation via Homebrew

macOS or Linux users can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install chrono-ntp.

```bash
brew tap ingk/chrono-ntp
brew install chrono-ntp
```

## Usage

Run chrono-ntp from your terminal:

```sh
chrono-ntp [options]
```

```
Usage of chrono-ntp:
  -server string
        NTP server to sync time from (default "time.google.com")
  -time-zone string
        Time zone name (e.g., 'America/New_York') (default "Local")
  -show-time-zone
        Show the time zone
  -time-format string
        Format for displaying time (ISO8601, 12h, 12h_AM_PM, .beat) (default "ISO8601")
  -hide-date
        Hide the current date
  -hide-statusbar
        Hide the status bar
  -beeps
        Play 6 beeps at the end of each minute, with the sixth beep at second 0 (emulates the Greenwich Time Signal)
  -debug
        Show debug information (e.g. offset from NTP server), then exit
```

### Configuration File

chrono-ntp supports a configuration file for default values. You can create a TOML file at `~/.chrono-ntp.toml` to specify your preferred options, which will be loaded automatically on startup.

Example `~/.chrono-ntp.toml`:

```toml
server = "time.google.com"
time-zone = "Europe/Berlin"
show-time-zone = true
time-format = "ISO8601"
hide-date = false
hide-statusbar = false
```

Any command-line options will override the values set in the configuration file.

### Example

```sh
chrono-ntp -server time.google.com -time-zone Europe/Berlin
```
